# Level Editor Progress Report

## Current Status: Advanced Paint Mode & Selection System Redesign

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed: Advanced Paint Mode System

#### **Paint Mode Enhancements**
- **3-State Tile System**: 
  - `-1` = Transparent tiles (checkered pattern - gray/light blue)
  - `0` = Empty tiles (white background)  
  - `1` = Filled tiles (black background)
- **Multi-Input Drawing**:
  - Left-click: Paint empty tiles (0)
  - Right-click: Paint filled tiles (1) 
  - **Shift + click: Eraser mode** - Sets tiles to transparent (-1)
- **Visual Feedback**: Cursor changes to red X when Shift is held
- **Auto-Outline Feature**: Automatically converts transparent tiles (-1) adjacent to empty tiles (0) into filled tiles (1)

#### **Interface Improvements**
- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean separation between "Tools" and "Visual Settings"
- **Color Customization**: Professional color swatches for grid lines, borders, and checker patterns
- **Settings Persistence**: All visual preferences saved to localStorage
- **Simplified Modes**: Removed complex toggle/setState modes, focused on intuitive Paint Mode

#### **Grid System Changes** 
- **5x5 Cell Size**: Changed from 8x5 to 5x5 tiles per cell for better granularity
- **All Cells Visible**: Removed complex visibility system - all cells always rendered
- **Transparent Default**: All tiles start as transparent (-1) instead of filled (1)

### üîß Current Focus: Selection System Redesign

#### **Current Selection System Analysis**
**What Works:**
- Rectangle selection with visual feedback (orange highlighting)
- Copy/paste with Ctrl+C/V shortcuts  
- Pattern storage with transparency support
- Basic cell dragging functionality

**Major Issues Identified:**
- Multi-cell dragging acts like single cell
- Copy/paste system too rigid for dynamic workflows
- Mixed legacy single-cell vs new multi-cell systems
- Incomplete clone/stamp functionality

#### **Comprehensive Redesign Plan**

### üéØ **Vision: Professional-Grade Selection System**

Transform from basic cell editor to professional level design tool with:

#### **Phase 1: Core Selection & Movement** üèóÔ∏è
- **Multi-Cell Dragging**: Fix dragging to work with full selections
- **Smart Movement**: Drag/nudge selections with conflict resolution
- **Arrow Key Nudging**: Move selections with keyboard
- **Conflict Resolution Modes**: 
  - Swap: Exchange content with destination
  - Push: Move existing content out of the way
  - Overwrite: Replace destination content
- **Non-Destructive Preview**: See changes before committing

#### **Phase 2: Transform & Stamp System** üîÑ
- **Stamp/Pattern Mode**: Replace copy/paste with intuitive stamping
- **Transform Tools**: Flip horizontal/vertical, rotate selections
- **Pattern Placement**: Easy placement of copied patterns
- **Preview System**: Show pattern placement before confirming

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Grid System** üìê
- **Off-Grid Movement**: Move selections not aligned to cell boundaries
- **Adjustable Working Grid**: Secondary grid with custom size/offset
- **Grid Alignment Options**: Snap to main grid or working grid
- **Flexible Positioning**: Professional-level placement control

#### **Phase 4: Pattern Library Redesign** üìö
- **Rename to "Pattern Library"**: Better reflects dynamic nature
- **Dynamic Pattern Sizes**: Support arbitrary rectangular patterns
- **Dual Cell Concepts**: 
  - Fixed 5x5 cells for room editing mode
  - Dynamic patterns for flexible shape storage
- **Improved Organization**: Categories, search, better management

### **Technical Architecture**

#### **Selection System Components**
- **Multi-Cell Selection**: Rectangle selection with proper multi-cell handling
- **Preview Layer**: Non-destructive overlay for showing potential changes
- **Transform Engine**: Handle flip/rotate operations on tile data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart handling of overlapping placements
- **Pattern Storage**: Enhanced system for dynamic pattern sizes

#### **Grid System Enhancements**
- **Primary Grid**: Current 5x5 cell system for room structure  
- **Working Grid**: Adjustable overlay grid for flexible placement
- **Coordinate Systems**: Proper handling of multiple grid alignments
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear feedback for grid modes and alignments

### **Development Priority**

#### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Fix Multi-Cell Dragging**: Make selections drag as unified groups
2. **Add Preview Layer**: Non-destructive movement preview system
3. **Implement Arrow Key Nudging**: Keyboard-based selection movement
4. **Add Conflict Resolution**: Choose how overlapping placements work

#### **Current Implementation Status**
- **Paint Mode**: ‚úÖ Complete and polished
- **Basic Selection**: ‚úÖ Working but needs major enhancements  
- **Auto-Outline**: ‚úÖ Complete and integrated
- **Visual Settings**: ‚úÖ Professional tabbed interface complete
- **Pattern System**: üîß Needs complete redesign

### **Design Philosophy Evolution**

#### **From Simple to Professional**
The editor is evolving from a basic cell-based tool into a comprehensive level design system that rivals professional tools while maintaining ease of use.

#### **Key Principles**
- **Non-Destructive Workflow**: Preview changes before committing
- **Flexible Grid Systems**: Work within structure or break free when needed  
- **Intuitive Controls**: Professional power with approachable interface
- **Dynamic Patterns**: Move beyond fixed cell sizes to flexible shapes
- **Smart Automation**: Auto-outline and smart conflict resolution

### **Technical Foundation Status**

#### **Solid Base Established** ‚úÖ
- Canvas rendering system handles complex operations efficiently
- 3-state tile system provides full flexibility (-1, 0, 1)  
- Event handling supports complex multi-tool workflows
- Settings and persistence systems are robust
- Visual feedback systems provide clear user guidance

#### **Ready for Advanced Features** üöÄ
The current foundation is solid enough to support the comprehensive selection system redesign. The paint mode provides a stable base while we build the advanced selection and pattern tools.

**Current Priority**: Begin Phase 1 - Fix multi-cell dragging and add preview layer
**Status**: Ready to implement - solid foundation established
**Risk Level**: Low - core systems are stable and well-tested
