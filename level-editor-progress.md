# Level Editor Progress Report

## What We Were Working On

### Current Implementation: Room Blockout Mode
We've been building a **hierarchical grid-based level editor** with a multi-scale approach. The current focus has been on the first layer of the system - what we call "Room Blockout Mode."

### System Architecture Built So Far

**Grid Hierarchy:**
- **Room Grid**: 9x9 grid of cells (configurable)
- **Cell Size**: 8x5 tiles per cell (160x160 pixels at 32px tiles)
- **Drawing System**: Inverted from original plan - cells start filled, drawing creates empty space
- **Tile Size**: 32x32 pixels

### Key Features Implemented

#### âœ… Core Drawing System
- **Inverted Logic**: Cells start completely filled (all tiles = 1), drawing creates empty space (tiles = 0)
- **Star Pattern Brushes**: 
  - Size 1: 1 tile
  - Size 2: 5 tiles (plus/star pattern)
  - Size 3: 9 tiles (3x3 square)
  - Size 4: 13 tiles (3x3 + extensions)
  - Size 5: 25 tiles (5x5 square)
- **Brush Preview**: Orange semi-transparent overlay showing affected tiles
- **Brush Size Controls**: Slider + Ctrl+Scroll to adjust size (1-5)

#### âœ… Cell Activity System
- **Active Cells**: Show white background when modified from default state
- **Inactive Cells**: Show light gray background when in default filled state
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Only active cells show their content/borders
- **Activity Detection**: Cells become active when they have empty tiles or connection tiles

#### âœ… Multi-Mode Interface
- **Blockout Mode**: Primary drawing mode for creating empty spaces
- **Room Connection Tile Mode**: Place yellow connection tiles on cell edges
- **Select Cell Mode**: Select individual cells for manipulation
- **Clone Mode**: Duplicate cell content

#### âœ… Cell Management System
- **Cell Selection**: Orange highlighted cell with corner markers
- **Cell Operations**: Clear cell, fill cell
- **Cell Dragging**: Move/swap cells within the grid
- **Swap Mode Toggle**: Choose between moving or swapping when dragging cells

#### âœ… Visual System
- **Zoom & Pan**: Mouse wheel zoom, middle-click pan, WASD/arrow key pan
- **Grid Lines**: Darker tile grid lines (#999999) visible on both active/inactive cells
- **Cell Borders**: Lighter blue borders (#4d9fff) around cells
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Active cells: White background (#ffffff)
  - Inactive cells: Light gray background (#e8e8e8)
  - Grid lines: Dark gray (#999999)
  - Cell borders: Light blue (#4d9fff)

#### âœ… Cell Library System (Just Completed!)
- **Visual Shelf**: Horizontal shelf below canvas showing saved cell thumbnails
- **Drag-to-Save**: Drag selected cells to canvas drop zone to save them
- **Canvas Drop Zone**: Green drop area rendered ON the canvas (not HTML overlay)
- **Drag-to-Load**: Drag thumbnails from shelf to canvas to place cells
- **Cell Previews**: Mini canvas thumbnails showing cell content
- **Auto-Generated Names**: Timestamp-based naming (cell-2025-01-15-14-30-25)
- **Delete Functionality**: Red Ã— button on hover to remove cells
- **localStorage Persistence**: Saved cells survive browser refresh

#### âœ… Room Library System
- **Save/Load Rooms**: Save entire room state with all cells
- **JSON Storage**: Complete room data with metadata
- **Auto-Generated Names**: Timestamp-based room names

### Technical Architecture

#### Canvas Rendering System
- **Fixed Canvas Size**: 800x600 pixels (configurable in HTML)
- **World Coordinates**: Proper viewport transformations for zoom/pan
- **Layered Rendering**: Cell backgrounds â†’ tiles â†’ grid lines â†’ borders â†’ previews â†’ drop zones
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only renders visible tiles and cells

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// Core tile data: 2D array where 1 = filled, 0 = empty, 2 = connection
this.tileData[y][x] = tileValue;

// Active cell tracking
this.activeCells = new Set(); // Contains "x,y" strings

// Cell library storage (localStorage)
{
  "cell-2025-01-15-14-30-25": {
    name: "cell-2025-01-15-14-30-25",
    timestamp: "2025-01-15T14:30:25.000Z",
    cellSize: { width: 8, height: 5 },
    data: [[1,1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,0,1], ...], // 2D array
    isActive: true,
    version: "1.0"
  }
}
```

#### Coordinate Systems
- **Canvas Coordinates**: Mouse position on HTML canvas
- **World Coordinates**: Transformed coordinates accounting for zoom/pan
- **Tile Coordinates**: Individual tile positions in the grid
- **Cell Coordinates**: Which cell (0-8, 0-8) in the room grid

### User Workflow Achieved
1. **Drawing**: Use blockout mode to carve empty spaces in filled cells
2. **Connections**: Place yellow connection tiles on cell edges
3. **Cell Management**: Select, move, swap, clear, or fill individual cells
4. **Saving**: Select cell â†’ drag to green drop zone â†’ appears in shelf
5. **Loading**: Drag thumbnail from shelf â†’ drop on canvas â†’ cell placed
6. **Room Management**: Save entire room state, load saved rooms

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. Polish Current Cell Library
- **Better Naming System**: Allow custom names for saved cells instead of just timestamps
- **Cell Categories**: Organize cells by type (platforms, vertical shafts, etc.)
- **Search/Filter**: Find cells in large libraries
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple cells, export/import cell packs

#### 2. Room Library Enhancement  
- **Visual Room Previews**: Show thumbnail of entire room in room library
- **Room Metadata**: Add room descriptions, difficulty tags, themes
- **Room Templates**: Create starter room templates

#### 3. Connection System
- **Smart Connections**: Detect and highlight how cells connect
- **Connection Validation**: Warn when cells don't connect properly
- **Auto-Connection**: Tools to ensure seamless cell transitions

### Medium-Term Goals

#### 4. Detailed Room Editor (Next Major Phase)
Based on the nextsteps.md file, the plan is to build a **second layer** of editing:

- **16x10 Resolution**: Each cell becomes a 16x10 tile detailed editor
- **Seamless Zoom**: Click cell in Room Blockout Mode â†’ zoom into detailed editor
- **Tile-Level Detail**: Fine-tune individual tiles within each cell
- **Dual-Scale Workflow**: Rough blockout â†’ detailed refinement

#### 5. World Editor (Final Layer)
- **Multi-Room System**: Place saved rooms in larger world grid
- **World Map**: Visual overview of connected rooms
- **World Testing**: Play through entire worlds seamlessly
- **World Export**: Generate game-ready level data

### Technical Debt & Improvements

#### Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Split large LevelEditor class into smaller components
- **Separate Concerns**: Move cell library, room library, and rendering into separate classes
- **Event System**: Implement proper event dispatching for UI updates

#### Performance
- **Viewport Culling**: Only process visible tiles/cells (partially implemented)
- **Efficient Rendering**: Cache cell thumbnails, reduce redraw frequency
- **Memory Management**: Clean up unused canvas contexts and data

#### User Experience
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add hotkeys for common operations
- **Context Menus**: Right-click menus for cell operations
- **Tool Palette**: Better organization of drawing tools
- **Status Display**: Show current tool, brush size, selected cell info

### Long-Term Vision

Based on the original nextsteps.md plan, the ultimate goal is a **three-layer hierarchical editor**:

1. **World Editor**: Place rooms in world grid
2. **Room Blockout Mode**: Current system - design room layout with cells
3. **Detailed Room Editor**: Fine-tune individual tiles within cells

This system enables:
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Block out levels quickly at room level
- **Detailed Refinement**: Polish individual areas at tile level  
- **Modular Design**: Reuse proven room components across worlds
- **Scale Testing**: Easy to experiment with different room/cell proportions

## Current Status Assessment

### What's Working Well âœ…
- **Solid Foundation**: Core canvas rendering and interaction system is robust
- **Intuitive Interface**: Drawing feels natural with good visual feedback
- **Flexible System**: Easy to adjust cell sizes, brush patterns, colors
- **Data Management**: Library system works smoothly with drag-and-drop
- **Performance**: Handles zoom/pan smoothly even with large grids

### Areas for Improvement ðŸ”§
- **Code Organization**: Large monolithic class needs refactoring
- **User Feedback**: Need better visual indicators for actions/states
- **Error Handling**: More graceful handling of edge cases
- **Mobile Support**: Touch interaction could be improved
- **Documentation**: Need user guide for complex workflow

### Ready for Next Phase ðŸš€
