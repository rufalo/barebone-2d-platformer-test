# Next Steps for Platformer Development

## Immediate Priority Features

### Player State Machine Implementation

#### Current State Management Issues:
- Multiple overlapping boolean flags create conflicts
- Wall run visual feedback doesn't persist properly  
- State transitions have timing race conditions
- Visual priority system is fragile and unreliable

#### Boost Chain State Machine Architecture:
- **Base States** (exclusive): idle, walking, running, jumping, falling, wall_sliding, crouching, dashing, sliding
- **Boost States** (enhancement layer): boost_ready, boost_active, boost_jump, boost_dash, boost_wallrun
- **Status Flags** (concurrent): boost_chainable, boost_energy_full, boost_momentum, can_wall_kick, facing_direction

#### Implementation Requirements:
- **BoostStateManager class**: Centralized state management
- **Energy System**: 300ms base, +200ms chain extensions, 1000ms max, 500ms cooldown
- **Visual Feedback System**: State-based colors with energy intensity
- **Chain Timing Windows**: Jump (200ms), dash (150ms), wall (300ms) extensions

#### Key Benefits:
- Eliminates competing boolean flag conflicts
- Provides clear visual feedback hierarchy  
- Enables boost chaining mechanics (boost→jump→dash→wallrun)
- Creates foundation for future states (hurt, invincible, etc.)

### Platform System Improvements

#### Current Platform Issues:
- Bounds-based detection can be imprecise
- Player gets "carried" even when slightly beside platform
- No clear separation between collision and "riding" detection

#### Trigger Zone Approach:
- **Separate collision boxes**:
  - **Solid collision**: Normal platform physics (can't pass through)
  - **Trigger zone**: Invisible area on top for "riding" detection
- **Trigger zone benefits**:
  - More precise "on platform" detection
  - Can be larger/smaller than visual platform
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Better debug visualization

#### Implementation Concepts:
- **Platform components**: 
  - Visual sprite (what you see)
  - Physics body (solid collision)  
  - Trigger zone (riding detection)
- **Trigger events**: `onTriggerEnter`, `onTriggerStay`, `onTriggerExit`
- **Multi-platform handling**: Player can only "ride" one platform at a time
- **Debug visualization**: Show trigger zones in debug mode

#### Advanced Platform Features:
- **One-way platforms**: Can jump through from below
- **Moving platform chains**: Platforms that follow paths
- **Conditional platforms**: Appear/disappear based on conditions
- **Platform types**: Ice (slippery), conveyor belts, bouncy

## Future Development Ideas

### Combat & Enemies
- **Basic enemies**: Simple AI patterns (patrol, chase, jump)
- **Enemy types**: Ground walkers, flying enemies, turret-style shooters
- **Combat mechanics**: Stomp-to-kill, shoot-to-kill, invincibility frames
- **Health system**: Player HP, enemy HP, damage feedback

### Level Design & Progression
- **Multiple levels**: Level loading system, progression tracking
- **Checkpoints**: Save points within levels
- **Collectibles**: Coins, power-ups, ability unlocks
- **Environmental hazards**: Spikes, pits, moving hazards

### Advanced Movement
- **Enhanced wall mechanics**: Wall run visual persistence, context-sensitive wall kicks
- **Swimming**: Water physics, underwater movement
- **Grappling hook**: Point-and-swing mechanics
- **Movement v3**: New experimental movement system with boost integration

### Visual & Polish
- **Particle effects**: Enhanced feedback for actions
- **Screen effects**: Camera shake improvements, screen transitions
- **Real sprites**: Replace colored rectangles with actual art
- **Animations**: Sprite animations for movement states

### Audio System
- **Sound effects**: Jump, dash, shoot, enemy hit sounds
- **Background music**: Level themes, menu music
- **Audio feedback**: Directional audio, volume controls

### UI & Menus
- **Main menu**: Start, options, level select
- **Pause system**: In-game pause with resume/restart options
- **HUD elements**: Health, score, ability cooldown indicators

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Save system**: Game progress, settings persistence
- **Performance**: Optimization, object pooling
- **Mobile support**: Touch controls, responsive scaling

## Integration Notes

The platform system improvements would integrate well with the existing movement v1/v2 framework:

- **Improved platforms** would make all movement feel more reliable
- **Platform trigger zones** would work seamlessly with current dash/slide mechanics

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Player State Machine** - Fixes fundamental state management and visual feedback issues
2. **BoostStateManager Implementation** - Enables boost chaining and reliable wall run indicators
3. **Platform trigger zones** - Improves fundamental movement reliability  
4. **Advanced platform types** - Expand level design possibilities

## State Machine Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
1. Create `BoostStateManager` class with state categories
2. Replace boolean flags with state machine methods
3. Implement energy system with configurable timers

### Phase 2: Visual System Overhaul  
1. State-based visual feedback (replaces current fragile system)
2. Energy intensity indicators
3. Chain combo visual effects

### Phase 3: Boost Chain Mechanics
1. Chain timing windows and energy extensions
2. Combo system (boost→jump→dash→wallrun)
3. Debug visualization for state transitions

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Update debug menu for new state system
2. Test all existing movement interactions
3. Performance optimization and cleanup
