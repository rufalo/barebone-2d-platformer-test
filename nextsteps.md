# Next Steps: Professional Level Design System

## Current Status: Advanced Paint Mode Complete, Selection System Redesign Phase

The level editor has evolved from a basic hierarchical grid concept into a comprehensive professional-grade level design system with advanced paint tools and a planned sophisticated selection system.

## ‚úÖ Paint Mode System - Complete

### **Current Paint Mode Capabilities**
- **3-State Tile System**: Transparent (-1), Empty (0), Filled (1) with distinct visual styles
- **Intuitive Controls**: Left-click/Right-click/Shift+click for complete tile control
- **Auto-Outline Feature**: Intelligent border generation around empty areas
- **Professional Interface**: Tabbed UI with customizable visual settings
- **Eraser Mode**: Shift+click for precise transparent tile placement

### **Technical Foundation Established**
- Robust canvas rendering system with efficient zoom/pan
- 5x5 cell grid optimized for detailed work
- 3-state tile data structure providing full flexibility
- Settings persistence and professional color customization
- Stable event handling supporting complex multi-tool workflows

## üéØ Next Major Focus: Professional Selection System

### **Vision: Transform into Professional-Grade Tool**

Evolution from basic cell editor to comprehensive level design system that rivals professional tools while maintaining intuitive workflow.

### **Selection System Redesign - 4 Phase Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Core Selection & Movement (Immediate Priority)**

**Multi-Cell Operations:**
- Fix multi-cell dragging to work with full selections instead of single cells
- Implement arrow key nudging for precise selection movement
- Add non-destructive preview layer showing changes before committing

**Smart Conflict Resolution:**
- **Swap Mode**: Exchange content between source and destination
- **Push Mode**: Move existing content out of the way intelligently  
- **Overwrite Mode**: Replace destination content completely
- UI controls for selecting resolution mode

**Technical Implementation:**
- Preview layer rendering system for non-destructive editing
- Enhanced coordinate system handling multiple selection types
- Conflict detection and resolution algorithms
- Visual feedback for all movement operations

#### **Phase 2: Transform & Stamp System**

**Replace Copy/Paste with Stamp System:**
- Intuitive pattern stamping interface replacing rigid copy/paste
- Visual pattern preview during placement
- One-click pattern application with confirmation

**Transform Tools:**
- **Flip Operations**: Horizontal and vertical flipping of selections
- **Rotation**: 90-degree increments with proper tile data transformation
- **Combined Operations**: Chain transforms before applying
- **Preview System**: See all transforms before committing

**Pattern Placement:**
- Smart pattern placement with grid awareness
- Transparency handling for overlay patterns
- Multiple placement modes (single, repeat, array)

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Grid System**

**Flexible Grid Options:**
- **Primary Grid**: Current 5x5 cell system for structural editing
- **Working Grid**: Adjustable overlay grid with custom size and offset
- **Off-Grid Movement**: Move selections without grid constraints
- **Grid Alignment Modes**: Snap to different grid types or freeform

**Professional Positioning:**
- Sub-cell precision for detailed work
- Grid magnetism with configurable strength
- Visual grid indicators for current alignment mode
- Coordinate display for precise placement

#### **Phase 4: Dynamic Pattern Library**

**Enhanced Pattern System:**
- **Rename to "Pattern Library"**: Better reflects dynamic capabilities
- **Arbitrary Pattern Sizes**: Support rectangular patterns of any dimensions
- **Dual Concepts**: 
  - Fixed 5x5 cells for room structural editing
  - Dynamic patterns for flexible shapes and details

**Advanced Organization:**
- **Pattern Categories**: Organize by type, theme, or function
- **Search and Filter**: Find patterns in large libraries quickly
- **Pattern Metadata**: Tags, descriptions, usage statistics
- **Import/Export**: Share pattern libraries between projects

## **Implementation Architecture**

### **Core Systems Enhancement**

#### **Selection Engine**
```javascript
class SelectionEngine {
    // Multi-cell rectangle selection with proper group handling
    // Transform operations (flip, rotate) on tile data
    // Preview layer for non-destructive editing
    // Conflict resolution algorithms
}
```

#### **Preview System**
```javascript
class PreviewLayer {
    // Non-destructive overlay rendering
    // Real-time transform preview
    // Conflict visualization
    // Confirmation/cancellation handling
}
```

#### **Pattern System**
```javascript
class PatternLibrary {
    // Dynamic pattern storage (arbitrary sizes)
    // Pattern categorization and search
    // Enhanced metadata handling
    // Import/export functionality
}
```

#### **Grid Manager**
```javascript
class GridManager {
    // Primary grid (5x5 cells)
    // Working grid (adjustable)
    // Off-grid positioning
    // Grid alignment and snapping
}
```

### **Data Structure Evolution**

#### **Current Tile System (Stable Foundation)**
```javascript
// 3-state tile system ready for advanced operations
tileData[y][x] = -1; // Transparent (checkered)
tileData[y][x] = 0;  // Empty (white)  
tileData[y][x] = 1;  // Filled (black)
```

#### **Enhanced Pattern Storage**
```javascript
{
    "patterns": {
        "platform_basic_3x1": {
            "name": "Basic Platform 3x1",
            "category": "platforms",
            "size": { "width": 3, "height": 1 },
            "tileData": [[1, 1, 1]],
            "origin": { "x": 1, "y": 0 },
            "metadata": {
                "tags": ["platform", "basic", "horizontal"],
                "description": "Simple horizontal platform",
                "usage_count": 15
            }
        }
    }
}
```
