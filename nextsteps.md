# Next Steps: Hierarchical Grid Level Editor System

## Current Status
The state machine implementation is complete and functional. Now focusing on building a hierarchical grid-based level editor for rapid level creation and modular world building.

## Level Editor Vision: Grid of Grids System

### Core Concept
A **two-layer hierarchical grid system** that enables both rapid level blocking and detailed refinement:

1. **World Grid**: 8x8 grid of reusable level cells
2. **Level Cells**: Individual grids (e.g., 10x16 tiles) that can be named, stored, and reused
3. **Tile Level**: Each tile represents blocking (0 = empty, 1 = filled) for rapid level layout

### Hierarchy Structure
```
World Map (8x8 level cells)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Level Cell (10x16 tiles each - configurable)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tile (blocking: 0 or 1)
```

    "name": "Forest World",
    "size": { "width": 8, "height": 8 },
    "cellGrid": [
      ["forest_start", "platform_01", null, null, ...],
      [null, "vertical_shaft", "jump_challenge", null, ...],
      ...
    ]
  },

- **Configurable**: Easy to test different sizes and find what works
- **Expandable**: Foundation for more complex features later
- **Low Risk**: Simple enough to scrap and restart if approach doesn't work

### Technical Foundation
- **Data Structure**: Simple 2D arrays for performance and clarity
